# Complement
*A food and beer pairing app*

## Purpose:
We wanted to build an app that allowed you to take the ingredients you had on hand and get a list of possible recipes you could make as well as find out what beers would pair with your meal choice. We also wanted this to work in the opposite direction where you chose a type of beer, got a list of beers, and then found a food that would pair well with that beer. 

## How it works:


## How to use:
The user can either start on the left or right side of the page for inputs. On the left you can type in a list of ingredients, a specific meal/recipe, or even a type of food like thai, mexican, etc. This will return a list of up to 10 recipes. These recipes can then be clicked which pops up a modal with a link to the actual recipe, the list of ingredients, and the beer pairing. Each ingredient can then be clicked which will strike-through the item so you can use the app while shopping to cross out what you already have.
